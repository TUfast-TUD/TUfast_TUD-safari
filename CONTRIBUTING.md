# Contributing

## TL;DR
- Before implementing a feature communicate with us via GitHub-Issues or Pull Requests. Code maintainers often have good suggestions regarding the implementation.
- Commit any changes (new features or hot-fixes) directly against the main branch.

## Getting started with browser extensions

If you never worked with browser extensions before, you should read this very [nice tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started). Alternatively you can use the instructions from [mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension). Make sure you understand the difference between content- and background-scripts, their scopes, and how they exchange information using messages.

## Working with this repo

Everything related to the browser extension can be found in `/src`: the `manifest.json`, the `background.js`, and so on. Content scripts are in `/src/contentScripts`. In `/src/freshContent` you can find newly created content that is used in TUfast, e.g. the popup or settings-page. `/docs` does _not_ contain documentation for the code, but further instructions for users of TUfast.

### Specialities in working with XCode
XCode is setup to use the `/build` directory as src.
When you build the app in XCode `npm run build` is automatically run (as a build phase)

Steps to contribute:

1. Create your local clone of this repo `git clone <url-of-your-repo>`.
3. Create a new feature branch directly from the main branch `git checkout -b <my_new_feature_branch>`.
4. Install dependencies `npm ci`. (You need node package manager `npm` installed.)
5. Open the XCode project inside `/TUfast-safari`
6. Build inside XCode and deploy either to the Simulator or your local Mac.
7. When Deploying to Mac, make sure to have "Allow unsigned extensions" checked in your Safari Developer Settings.
8. Run `npm run test` locally before pushing code. This will also check if your code is formatted correctly. You can use [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) to automatically format your code (recommended) or use `npm run prettier:fix`. (See also below.) Wrong formatting will result in failing CI on GitHub!
9. **Increase the version number in the `manifest*.json` files according to [SemVer](https://semver.org/). An increase in version number is strictly required for new TUfast releases!**
10. Create a pull request against `main`.
11. Await our review.

**Note:** as a member of the TUfast organization you can also work in this repo directly, e.g. you can create branches and push to them, making the contribution process easier.

## Used frameworks
- **Build tool**: [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/). Run `npm run dev` to compile sass and ts files.
- **CSS-Preprocessor**: We are using [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/).
- **Code style and linting**: We are using ESlint and prettier. Run `npm run test` to check your code style and linting before pushing code. Wrong formatting will result in a failing CI. You should configure your editor to automatically format on save with prettier for which VSCode provides [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).

## Known peculiarities and bugs
- `Unchecked runtime.lastError: The message port closed before a response was received.` Promisifying chrome.runtime.sendMessage({...}) doesnt work, because when you define a callback (Promise.resolve) sendMessage will wait until sendResponse is called in the message handler. It just stalls execution and then dies if it's never called. **Solutions:** 1) Unpromisify sendMessage. 2) Always return a value (return true is fine).
- **Prettier in Windows**: `npm run prettier` might show warning and git might show changes, although all files are formatted correctly visually. This is due to end-of-line conventions. For information and fix see [this issue](https://github.com/TUfast-TUD/TUfast_TUD/pull/157).

## Have fun developing! ðŸ”¥
